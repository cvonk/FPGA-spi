# FPGA-Arduino interface using SPI

The article [Math Talk](http://coertvonk.com/category/hw/math-talk) describes a protocol and implementation by which the FPGA can communicate with a microcontroller such as an Adruino. This repository holds the implementations of this SPI-based protocol.  

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous full-duplex serial interface commonly used to communicate with on-board peripherals such as FLASH memory, A/D converters, temperature sensors, or in our case a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).
